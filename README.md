## League of Legends Winner Prediction (First 10 Minutes)

This project predicts the winner of a League of Legends match based on gameplay data from the first 10 minutes. Using machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) implemented with PySpark, we analyze key in-game metrics to forecast match outcomes.

## Key Features
- Processes 10,000+ high-rank matches (Diamond to Master tier)
- Analyzes 38 features including kills, gold, objectives, and team statistics
- Big Data handling with Apache Spark
- Comparative analysis of multiple ML models

## Data Source
Dataset from Kaggle containing ranked matches collected via Riot Games API, featuring complete match statistics after 10 minutes of gameplay.

## Technologies
- Python
- PySpark
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

Developed as part of the Big Data course at Lodz University of Technology.
